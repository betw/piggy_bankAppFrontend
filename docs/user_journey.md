### User Journey
Sarah is a 26-year-old recent graduate who dreams of taking a trip to Tokyo with her friends. But every month, she finds herself overspending on small things and never setting aside enough money. The thought of saving feels overwhelming, and she worries she’ll never make her dream vacation happen.

One evening, after realizing yet again that she has little left over for savings, Sarah downloads the Piggy Bank app. On the home page (see sketch 1) she’s greeted by a simple map interface where she can set her “From” and “To” destinations. She selects Boston → Tokyo and instantly feels like her vague dream is becoming a concrete goal.

Next, Sarah navigates to the Travel Goals overview (sketch 2). She sees a list of potential trips she’s set up, each with a progress meter showing how much she has saved so far. For Tokyo, she’s only just begun—0% progress. The clean layout and visual feedback help her see exactly where she stands without any confusion.

Curious to make a plan, she taps her Tokyo goal and moves into the Goal Detail page (sketch 3). Here, she adjusts the sliders to commit to saving $250 per month for the next 12 months. The app recalculates and shows her projected progress bar filling up over time. For the first time, she can picture a clear path from “wishful thinking” to actually boarding that flight.

Over the next few weeks, Sarah begins setting aside the recommended amount. On the Notifications page (sketch 4), she gets friendly reminders each month—“You’re 25% of the way to Tokyo!”—and celebratory nudges when she hits new milestones. Instead of guilt, she feels momentum.

By the end of the year, Sarah has hit her savings target. She opens the app one last time, sees her Tokyo goal at 100%, and books her flight. What once felt cumbersome has become easier, thanks to Piggy Bank helping her visualize, plan, and stick with her savings journey.
