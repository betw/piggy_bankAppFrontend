### User Journey
Sarah is a 26-year-old recent graduate who dreams of taking a trip to Tokyo with her friends. But every month, she finds herself overspending on small things and never setting aside enough money. The thought of saving feels overwhelming, and she worries she’ll never make her dream vacation happen.

One evening, after realizing yet again that she has little left over for savings, Sarah downloads the Piggy Bank app. On the home page, she’s greeted by a simple and inviting interface where she can set her “From” and “To” destinations. She selects Boston → Tokyo and instantly feels like her vague dream is becoming a concrete goal.

Next, Sarah explores her Travel Goals section, where she can see all the trips she’s planning, each showing how much she’s saved so far. For Tokyo, she’s just starting—0% progress. The clean layout and visual feedback help her clearly understand where she stands.

Determined to make a plan, she opens her Tokyo goal and decides to save $250 per month for the next 12 months. Instead of the app automatically tracking her progress, Sarah takes control: each time she saves money, she manually confirms the contribution in the app. As she enters each amount, her progress bar increases proportionally—she can see her efforts paying off little by little.

A few months later, Sarah reaches the halfway point of her goal. The app creates a notification celebrating her progress, which she can view on her Notifications page. It’s a small but satisfying milestone that keeps her motivated to continue.

By the end of the year, Sarah makes her final contribution. Her Tokyo goal reaches 100%, and another notification appears congratulating her on achieving her savings target. She opens the app, smiles at the fully completed progress bar, and books her flight.

What once felt overwhelming has become achievable—thanks to Piggy Bank helping her visualize her progress, take ownership of her savings, and celebrate her milestones along the way.
